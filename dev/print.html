<p>We must (re)write the foundations of system software on more solid ground. Even <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Final-ONCD-Technical-Report.pdf">POTUS roots for it</a>! For the Internet of Things, our cyberphysical world under continuous development, <strong>we  need stronger cybersecurity</strong>. </p>
<p>So what does it mean for the main embedded operating systems targeting networked microcontrollers (Zephyr, FreeRTOS, or <a href="https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/">RIOT</a>) which are primarily written in C? </p>
<p>Well, how about using instead a memory-safe language, <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, as foundation. And for good measure, how about formal verification for the critical modules cherry-picked incrementally, along the way. Implementing the above guidelines is exactly the mission of <a href="https://github.com/future-proof-iot/RIOT-rs">RIOT-rs</a>: collaboration to produce open source re-write(s) of RIOT core modules providing a basis for next-level cybersecurity in IoT.</p>
<p>Curious about more details on principles driving RIOT-rs development? Here you go. </p>
<p><em>Southbound</em>, RIOT-rs builds on top of <a href="https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy">Embassy</a> which provides an awesome open source HAL for a large variety of low-power IoT hardware, written in Rust. </p>
<p><em>Northbound</em>, RIOT-rs provides high-level APIs working nicely across all supported hardware (work-in-progress) for generic sensors/actuators interaction (such as <a href="https://api.riot-os.org/group__drivers__saul.html">SAUL</a>) and for generic network I/O (such as <a href="https://api.riot-os.org/group__net__sock.html">sock</a>). </p>
<p><em>At the core</em>, RIOT-rs provides a programming framework for both async and blocking (threads with priorities) paradigms and convenient scaffolding to bundle various the libraries and 3rd party modules you need. </p>
<p>True to the spirit of RIOT development, RIOT-rs aims at a level of integration and <strong>code portability</strong> such that ~95% of the code is reused as-is on all supported hardware. The targeted <strong>memory footprint</strong> (RAM &amp; Flash) is measured in tens of kBytes. The targeted <strong>power consumption</strong> levels enable applications lasting 1+ years on a small battery.</p>
<p>Last but not least the CI process for each pull-request to RIOT-rs includes extensive and rigorous tests which are automated for all supported configuration and hardware. And for selected modules, a <strong>formal verification workflow</strong> is used based on <a href="https://github.com/hacspec/hax">hax</a>, running directly on the functional Rust.</p>
<p>Long story short: RIOT-rs embodies the developing love affair between RIOT and embedded Rust, fostering stronger IoT cybersecurity. This is a joyous open source community, so... you're welcome to <a href="https://github.com/future-proof-iot/RIOT-rs">join us</a>! </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p><strong>RIOT-rs</strong> RIOT-rs is a project aiming to provide a general-purpose 
operating system adequate for low-power Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
<p>RIOT-rs is based on Rust from the ground up, and formal verification for critical modules. 
It combines the awesome Rust embedded ecosystem with RIOT OS.</p>
<p>RIOT-rs builds on top of the hardware abstraction layer 
and async programming framework provided by
<a href="https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy">embassy</a> and 
drivers via embedded-HAL.</p>
<p>Aiming to cover versatile use cases, RIOT-rs integrates and combines 
the above HAL with a preemptive scheduler, 
a set of efficient operating system facilities, a bootloader, 
and a curated ecosystem of libraries (available via crates.io)
for cybersecure, memory-safe IoT. </p>
<p>As a result, a low-power IoT developer can focus on business logic
sitting on top of APIs which remain close to the hardware but
nevertheless stay the same across all supported hardware.
The intent is three-fold: decrease application development time,
increase code portability, and decrease core system vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>RIOT-rs can also be used to host legacy C application and libraries.
However, the essence and ultimate goal of the RIOT-rs is to
provide everything one might need in Rust.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="riot-rs-code-of-conduct"><a class="header" href="#riot-rs-code-of-conduct">RIOT-rs Code of Conduct</a></h1>
<p>RIOT-rs, like so many other free and open source software projects, is made up of a
mixed group of professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on
every aspect of our goals - including teaching, steering, and connecting people.</p>
<p>We want diversity to be one of our greatest strengths, but it can also lead to
communication issues and unhappiness. This is why we ask people to adhere to a
few ground rules. They apply equally to founders, maintainers, contributors and
those seeking help and guidance.</p>
<p>This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of things you are not allowed to do.
We rather would like you to think of it as a guide to enrich our community and
the technical community in general with new knowledge and perspectives by
allowing everyone to participate.</p>
<p>This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the RIOT-rs community. This
includes Matrix, the mailing lists, our GitHub projects, face to face events, and
any other forums created by the community for communication within the
community. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may also
affect a person's ability to participate within them.</p>
<p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report
it by emailing <a href="mailto:conduct@riot-rs.org">conduct@riot-rs.org</a>. For more details please see our <a href="https://future-proof-iot.github.io/RIOT-rs/dev/CoC_reporting.html">Reporting
Guidelines</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Be welcoming.</strong> We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited
to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour,
immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex,
sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family
status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.</li>
<li><strong>Be considerate.</strong> Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users
and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when
making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might
not be communicating in someone else's primary language.</li>
<li><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement
is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience
some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn
into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where
people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of
the RIOT-rs community should be respectful when dealing with other members as
well as with people outside the RIOT-rs community.</li>
<li><strong>Be careful in the words that you choose.</strong> We are a community of
professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others.
Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other
exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited
to:
<ul>
<li>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li>
<li>Discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
<li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
<li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying
information (&quot;doxing&quot;).</li>
<li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
<li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop,
then stop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>When we disagree, try to understand why.</strong> Disagreements, both social and
technical, happen all the time and RIOT-rs is no exception. It is important
that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember
that we’re different. The strength of RIOT-rs comes from its varied community,
people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different
perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a
viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to
err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on
helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.</li>

<h2 id="questions"><a class="header" href="#questions">Questions?</a></h2>
<p>If you have questions, please feel free to <a href="mailto:conduct@riot-rs.org">contact us</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you
report it to us by emailing <a href="mailto:conduct@riot-rs.org">conduct@riot-rs.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>All reports will be kept confidential.</strong> In some cases we may determine that a
public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all
victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct
us otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law
enforcement first.</strong> If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is
appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify
them.</p>
<p>If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space
where it happened is covered by this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still
report it. We would much rather have a few extra reports where we decide to take
no action, rather than miss a report of an actual violation. We do not look
negatively on you if we find the incident is not a violation. And knowing about
incidents that are not violations, or happen outside our spaces, can also help
us to improve the Code of Conduct or the processes surrounding it.</p>
<p>In your report please include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)</li>
<li>Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there
were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.</li>
<li>When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.</li>
<li>Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g.
a mailing list archive or a public Matrix logger) please include a link.</li>
<li>Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.</li>
<li>If you believe this incident is ongoing.</li>
<li>Any other information you believe we should have.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-happens-after-you-file-a-report"><a class="header" href="#what-happens-after-you-file-a-report">What happens after you file a report?</a></h3>
<p>You will receive an email from one of the core community members as soon as
possible. We promise to acknowledge receipt within 24 hours (and will aim for
much quicker than that).</p>
<p>They will review the incident and determine:</p>
<ul>
<li>What happened.</li>
<li>Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.</li>
<li>Who the bad actor was.</li>
<li>Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone's
physical safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety,
their immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved.
This means we may delay an &quot;official&quot; response until we believe that the
situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.</p>
<p>Once the working group has a complete account of the events they will make a
decision as to how to response. Responses may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).</li>
<li>A private reprimand from us to the individual(s) involved.</li>
<li>A public reprimand.</li>
<li>An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to &quot;take a week off&quot; from a mailing
list or Matrix).</li>
<li>A permanent or temporary ban from some or all RIOT-rs spaces (mailing lists,
Matrix, etc.)</li>
<li>A request for a public or private apology.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a
resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.</p>
<p>Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter to
let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll take into account
feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but we don't
guarantee we'll act on it.</p>

<h2 id="item-order-in-rust-modules"><a class="header" href="#item-order-in-rust-modules">Item Order in Rust Modules</a></h2>
<p>Items SHOULD appear in Rust modules in the following order, based on <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#auto-import">the one used by rust-analyzer</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inner doc comment</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes.html">Inner attributes</a></li>
<li>Unconditional—i.e., not feature-gated—bodyless <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/modules.html">modules</a></li>
<li>Conditional—i.e., feature-gated—bodyless modules</li>
<li>Unconditional imports from the following:
<ol>
<li><code>std</code>/<code>alloc</code>/<code>core</code></li>
<li>External crates (including crates from the same workspace)</li>
<li>Current crate, paths prefixed by <code>crate</code></li>
<li>Current module, paths prefixed by <code>self</code></li>
<li>Super module, paths prefixed by <code>super</code></li>
<li>Re-exports—i.e., <code>pub</code> imports not used in the module</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Conditional imports from the same</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/constant-items.html">Const items</a></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/static-items.html">Static items</a></li>
<li>Other items</li>
</ol>
<p>TODO: type aliases before other items?</p>
<p>TODO: how to organize type definitions w.r.t. related logic?</p>
<h2 id="imports"><a class="header" href="#imports">Imports</a></h2>
<p>Imports from the same crate with the same visibility MUST be <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#auto-import">merged into a single use statement</a>.</p>
<h2 id="comments"><a class="header" href="#comments">Comments</a></h2>
<h3 id="doc-comments"><a class="header" href="#doc-comments">Doc Comments</a></h3>
<p>All public items listed in the documentation—i.e., not marked with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/write-documentation/the-doc-attribute.html#hidden"><code>#[doc(hidden)]</code></a>—SHOULD be documented.</p>
<p>Doc comments MUST use the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/comments.html#doc-comments">line comment style</a>, not the block style.</p>
<p>Doc comments MUST be written in third person present, not in the imperative mood, as recommended by <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1574-more-api-documentation-conventions.md#summary-sentence">RFC 1574</a>.
Each sentence in doc comments—including the first one, before an empty line—SHOULD end with a period.
For instance, instead of:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>/// Get the underlying value
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>write:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>/// Returns the underlying value.
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>More generally, use the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/"><code>std</code> docs</a> as inspiration.</p>
<h2 id="unsafe-code"><a class="header" href="#unsafe-code"><code>unsafe</code> Code</a></h2>
<p>When <code>unsafe</code> is used, a <code>SAFETY</code> comment MUST be added, in the style <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#/undocumented_unsafe_blocks">supported by Clippy</a>.</p>
<p>TODO: enforce it in CI</p>
<h2 id="naming-conventions"><a class="header" href="#naming-conventions">Naming Conventions</a></h2>
<p>Names SHOULD adhere to the <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/naming.html">official API guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>TODO: how to name error types/error enum variants (<code>CannotDoSth</code> vs <code>DoingSth</code>)?</p>
<h2 id="dependencies"><a class="header" href="#dependencies">Dependencies</a></h2>
<p>If the same dependency is used in multiples crates within the workspace, that dependency SHOULD be specified in the <em>workspace</em>'s <code>Cargo.toml</code> file and workspace crates should import them from there.</p>
