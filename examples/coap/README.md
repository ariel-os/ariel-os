# coap demo

## About

This application is a work in progress demo of running CoAP with OSCORE/EDHOC security on RIOT-rs.

## Roadmap

Eventually, this should be a 20 line demo.

Until the CoAP roadmap is complete,
this serves as a work bench, test bed, demo zone and playground at the same time.
This application will grow as parts of the roadmap are added,
and shrink as they become default or are wrapped into components of RIOT-rs.
