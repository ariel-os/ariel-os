/// Categories a sensor driver can be part of.
///
/// A sensor driver may be part of multiple categories.
///
/// # For sensor driver implementors
///
/// Many MEMS sensor devices (e.g., accelerometers) include a temperature sensing element in
/// addition to their main sensing element, as temperature may slightly affect the measurement
/// results.
/// Sensor *drivers* are not under the obligation of exposing such temperature readings, even if
/// they are exposed by the sensor device.
/// They may however still be fetched by the sensor driver internally, especially to dynamically
/// compute the accuracy of the main reading returned by the sensor driver.
/// If temperature readings are not exposed by the sensor driver, the sensor driver must not be
/// considered part of a category that includes temperature ([`Category::Temperature`] or
/// [`Category::AccelerometerTemperature`] in the case of an accelerometer), even if the sensor
/// *device* does expose them.
///
/// Sensor drivers may be part of multiple categories and should then list all of them: e.g., being
/// part of the [`Category::AccelerometerTemperature`] does *not* imply also being part of the
/// [`Category::Accelerometer`] category, and the sensor should list both of them.
///
/// Missing variants can be added when required.
/// Please open an issue to discuss it.
