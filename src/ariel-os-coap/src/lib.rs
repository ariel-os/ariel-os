//! A CoAP stack preconfigured for Ariel OS.
//!
//! This crate mainly provides easy-to-use wrappers around the [`coapcore`] crate, with presets
//! tailored towards Ariel OS: It utilizes [`embassy_net`] to open a network accessible CoAP socket
//! and selects [`embedded_nal_coap`] for CoAP over UDP, it selects [`ariel_os_random`] as a source
//! of randomness, and [`lakers_crypto_rustcrypto`] for the cryptographic algorithm
//! implementations.

// Moving work from https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/pull/2519 in here for the time being
