//! Pass non-Send objects around on same executor.
//!
//! This module provides [`SameExecutorCell`], a structure that allows passing around
//! non-Send objects from one async task to another, if they are on the same
//! executor. This is allowed because embassy executors are single threaded.
//!
//! [`SameExecutorCell`] checks for the correct executor *at runtime*.

// SAFETY:
// SameExecutorCell guarantees at runtime that its content stays on the same embassy
// executor. Those are single threaded, so it is guaranteed that the content
// stays on the same thread.
// While `SameExecutorCell::get()` allows passing any `Spawner` object, those are `!Send`,
// thus they are guaranteed to be for the current Executor.
